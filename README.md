### A Very Big Sum
In this challenge, you are required to calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

### Designer PDF Viewer
When a contiguous block of text is selected in a PDF viewer, the selection is highlighted with a blue rectangle. In this PDF viewer, each word is highlighted independently.

There is a list of 26 character heights aligned by index to their letters. For example, 'a' is at index 0 and 'z' is at index 25. There will also be a string. Using the letter heights given, determine the area of the rectangle highlight in mm^2 assuming all letters are 1mm wide.

### Left Rotation
A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements 1 unit to the left. For example, if 2 left rotations are performed on array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then the array would become [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]. Note that the lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation. This is called a circular array.

Given an array a of n integers and a number, d, perform d left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.
